# STORI.ES TERMS OF SERVICE

These Terms of Service (“TOS”) describe permitted and prohibited uses by you of the stori.es platform service offered by Consumers Union of United States, Inc. (“CU”), a not-for-profit corporation.  In these TOS, “you” and “your” refer to each Recipient and its Authorized Users of the Service.  Capitalized terms in these TOS, to the extent they are not defined herein, are defined in the stori.es Beta Release Software as a Service (“SaaS”) Agreement  [ TODO ].  

You represent and warrant that you are authorized to enter into these TOS on behalf of the Recipient.  CU is not involved in the management of your implementation of the Service in your own products and services or decisions related to the content that Recipients collect, transmit, store and publish via the Service, including the terms and conditions and policies that its Recipients apply to their members or any other End Users.  Recipients are solely responsible for their implementation of the Service and the acts and omissions of their members and End Users, and managing their use of this Service in compliance with these Terms of Service.

CU may modify these TOS at any time by posting a revised version on the Service.  By using the Service, you agree to the latest version of these TOS.  If you violate these TOS or help others to do so, we may immediately suspend or terminate your use of the Service.

### No Illegal, Harmful, or Offensive Use or Content

### No Security Violations
You and your End Users may not breach or attempt to breach the security of the Service, including using the Service to violate the security or integrity of any network, computer or communications system, software application, or network or computing device (each, a “System”).  Prohibited activities include:

### No E-mail or Other Message Abuse
Neither you nor your End Users may use any area of the Service to send the same or substantially similar unsolicited electronic mail messages or other messages, promotions, advertising, solicitations and informational announcements (like “spam”), whether commercial in nature or not.  This prohibition includes sending unsolicited mass mailings from another Internet service which in any way involves the use of the Service or any equipment owned or operated by CU in connection with the Service.  You and your End Users will not alter or obscure mail headers or assume a sender’s identity without the sender’s explicit permission.  You and your End Users will not collect replies to messages sent from another internet service provider if those messages violate these TOS or the acceptable use policy of that provider.

## 5. NOTICE OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT
We intend that all Content provided on the Service respect the copyright and other proprietary rights of third parties.  When Service visitors post Content on our Service, we are unable to monitor the copyright ownership of all posted Content.  If at any time you believe that any Content on the Service infringes your copyrighted material, then you may request the Content be removed in accordance with the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. §512(c)(3), and procedures described below.  

You must send a notice that complies with the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. §512(c)(3) (“Notice”) to the agent we have designated with the Copyright Office:

Ms. Wendy Wintman, Manager, Records Management and Legal Services  
Telephone: (914) 378-2448  
Email: <WWintman@consumer.org>

To comply with the Copyright Act, your Notice must be in writing and must include:
1. A physical or electronic signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works;
3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material;
4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted;
5. A statement that you have a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

When we receive a Notice that complies with the Copyright Act, we will remove the identified material promptly.  We will promptly take reasonable steps to inform the End User who posted the allegedly infringing material (the “alleged infringer”) of the Notice and subsequent removal.  The alleged infringer may then provide us with a counter-notice (“Counter-Notice”) that the initial infringement notice was erroneous.  Such Counter-Notice must be in writing and must include:

1. A physical or electronic signature of the alleged infringer;
2. Identification of the material removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;
3. A statement under penalty of perjury that the alleged infringer has a good-faith belief that the material was removed or access to it disabled as a result of error;
4. The alleged infringer’s name, address, and telephone number; and
5. A statement of consent to jurisdiction in federal district court and that the alleged infringer consents to service of process from the complaining party or its agent.

Upon receipt of a Counter-Notice, we will notify you of the Counter-Notice and restore the material within 10 to 14 business days of receipt of the Counter-Notice unless you inform us that you have filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the allegedly infringing party from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on our Service.

Please note: the email address of our Designated Agent is intended specifically for the receipt of notices of claimed infringement under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, 17 U.S.C. §512.  It is not intended for general inquiries or permission requests concerning use of our Service or any content contained therein.
