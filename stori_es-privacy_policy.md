# STORI.ES PRIVACY POLICY

## SCOPE

This Privacy Policy describes how information is collected and used in connection with the stori.es platform service offered by Consumers Union of United States, Inc. (“CU,” “we” or “us”), a not-for-profit corporation.   In this Privacy Policy, “you” and “your” refer to each Authorized User of the Service.  Capitalized terms in this Privacy Policy, to the extent that they are not defined herein, are defined in the stori.es Beta Release Software as a Service (“SaaS”) Agreement [ TODO ].

## YOUR CONSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our Terms of Service [ TODO ].  By using the Service you consent to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, including our use and disclosure of your personal information as delineated in this Privacy Policy.

## INFORMATION WE COLLECT, HOW WE COLLECT IT AND HOW WE USE IT

Some of the information on our Service can be accessed without our collecting any personally identifiable information from you.  The information we gather through our Service falls into two categories:  (1) personally identifiable information (“PII,” further described below); and (2) tracking information collected as you and your End Users navigate the Service.

### Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

We collect PII that you voluntarily provide through our Service.  PII may include, for example, some or all of the following:  your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, mobile phone number, user name and password, and demographic information.

### Tracking Information Collected Through Technology

When you and your End Users use our Service, we or our service providers may collect tracking information which we aggregate for reporting to make our Service more useful to you. We use “cookies” to store and sometimes to track usage information.  Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us.  A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive.  A cookie contains a unique number that allows our Service to recognize your computer.  We use both temporary and persistent cookies.  A temporary cookie tracks visitor activity during a session or visit and it expires when you close your browser.  We use them to provide continuity for your visit.  Persistent cookies, such as our use of Google Analytics, allow us to collect and analyze non-personally identifiable tracking information about usage of the Service.  Google Analytics uses cookies to collect and report on visitor interactions (including visitor IP addresses).  CU has disabled the Google Analytics remarketing feature on our Service and has opted out of the Google Analytics’ automated data-sharing processes where permitted.  Information about Google’s privacy policy and the Google Analytics program can be found here: [
http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html ].

### Supplemental Information We May Receive From Other Sources

We may supplement information you give us with information from other sources, such as information to validate or update your address.  We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to enable us to fulfill our products and services, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes consistent with our mission.

### Advertising

We do not allow third-party ads on our Service.  

## THIRD PARTY SITES AND SERVICES

Our Service may contain links to third-party Web sites or access to third-party services for your convenience and information, such as Google.  Different rules will apply to their use and disclosure of personal information you disclose to them.  We are not responsible for and do not control the privacy practices or the content of those other sites or services so you should investigate their policies before you disclose your personal information to them.  Similarly, if you communicate with us through a company or service other than Consumers Union, such as a digital application service provider, telecommunication service provider, or social media service, then the privacy policy of that entity will control any information you provide to that third party and will operate independently of this Privacy Policy.  We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information.

## SHARING YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

We take very seriously our responsibility to maintain your privacy with respect to your PII.  We will share that information as described in this Privacy Policy.

### Sharing With Service Providers

We may contract with other companies to provide certain services on our behalf, including but not limited to web site and software hosting, digital publishing and analytics. We provide these companies only with the information they need to perform their services.

### Sharing for Legal Purposes or Sale of a Business

We reserve the right to share PII with legal authorities or governmental entities if required by law, or if we determine in our sole discretion that it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected illegal activities, any violations of our Terms of Service (including this Privacy Policy), or in connection with any safety or security concerns.

From time to time, we may purchase or establish a business, or sell one or more of our businesses and PII may be transferred as part of the merger or acquisition, creation of a separate business to provide certain of our products and services, or sale or pledge of our assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information would be transferred as one of our business assets.  Information, including personal information, about our customers and other users of our Web sites and other products and services may also need to be disclosed in connection with a transaction in which CU or one of our affiliates is seeking financing, investment, support or funding.  If we sell a business or engage in one of the other types of transactions noted above, personal information will be subject to the promises made in our privacy policy in effect at the time of the transfer of that information.

### Third-Party Use of Aggregate, Anonymous Data

We authorize certain service providers to utilize for their business purposes and in accordance with their privacy policies aggregated, anonymous information derived from data collected when the products and services they support on our behalf are used.  For example, these service providers may use this aggregated, anonymous information to report on website usage or industry trends to their customer base.  None of this information is personally identifying, nor are our service providers allowed to link it to any PII we collect.

## HOW YOU CAN HAVE ACCESS TO AND CORRECT YOUR INFORMATION

We provide you with the ability to access and edit the personal information that you have provided to us in your online account, if you have one.  To update your information, please access your profile and update your contact information and user preferences by following the instructions here: [
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OkO4bTvL92RO2zEmnJkUGNPbH2ao1I27lNO0LJzWDcI/edit?usp=sharing ].  For any further requests, contact us online at <stories@cr.consumer.org> or write to us at:

Attn: stori.es

## CHOICE/OPT OUT

### Service Related Announcements

We may send you emails relating to your account.  We may also send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.  You may not opt-out of these communications.

### Opting Out of Other Communications

If CU develops other types of communications, then we will provide you with the opportunity to opt out of receiving those communications.

## SECURITY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE

We work to protect your PII from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration.  We have put in place reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to help safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access and maintain security over the data we collect.  We use industry-recognized security safeguards such as firewalls and other security procedures to help protect your PII from loss or unauthorized access.  

If you set up an account with us, you are asked to establish a user name and password.  When you log on to your account, you will be asked to enter your user name and password to protect the security of your account.  If you want to change your password or other information, you may do so at any time by editing your account profile. If you have forgotten your user name and wish to log on, you will be asked to provide the email address you used when you created the account (or an updated email address that you have previously provided), and an email containing your user name will be sent promptly to that email address.  If you wish to log on to your account and have forgotten your password, the online system will request both your email address and your user name, and we will promptly send you an email with a temporary password.  You will be prompted to reset it to a new password.

It is your responsibility to control the dissemination and use of your user name and password and to control access to and use of your account.  We urge you to keep your password confidential and not disclose it to anyone.  We also recommend that you never reuse the same password across different websites and other online products and services.  Be sure to sign off when finished using the Service, especially if you are using a shared or public computer.  We will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this provision, for example, a third party’s unauthorized access to your information.

You may choose to send us emails or participate in an online discussion group or other public posting area of our Service.  Information disclosed in these areas is not secure or encrypted, and in the case of online discussion groups or other public posting areas, is available to anyone with Internet access.  Exercise caution when deciding to post any PII or confidential information by any of these methods.

IMPORTANT – Although we take these steps to protect your PII, no method of transmitting or storing electronic data is ever completely secure, therefore we cannot promise or guarantee that such information will never be accessed, used or released in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

### Security Enforcement

Any unauthorized access to or use of our Service or the information collected and maintained by us should be immediately brought to our attention by contacting us via email at <stories@cr.consumer.org> or by
writing to us at:

Consumers Union  
Attn: stori.es  
7020 Easy Wind Drive, Suite 250  
Austin, TX  78752

We will investigate, and, if necessary, take action to mitigate the harm from any violation of the security of your personal information of which we become aware.

In the unlikely event that we believe the security of your PII in our possession or control has been compromised, we will endeavor to provide required notice as soon as possible under the circumstances and if appropriate, will post notices on the stori.es Site.

## CHILDREN’S PRIVACY

Our Service is oriented toward a general audience and intended for adults only.  We do not knowingly request information from children.

## NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL USERS

CU is a New York not-for-profit organization headquartered in Yonkers, New York, USA.   If you are located outside of the United States, the PII you provide to us will be transferred to the United States and governed by applicable U.S. laws and regulations and this Privacy Policy.  Some of this information may be transferred to, processed and stored temporarily by our service providers in other countries. By submitting your PII, you consent to its transfer to and storage in the United States and other countries designated by us, its governance by U.S. laws and regulations, and its use in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time.  The most recent version of this Privacy Policy will always be posted on our Service at [ TODO ], with the “Effective Date” posted at the bottom.  We may revise and update this Privacy Policy if our practices change, as technology changes, or as we add new products and services or change existing ones.  If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy or how we handle your PII, you will know because the Effective Date of the Privacy Policy will change.  If we are going to use any PII in a manner that is materially different from that stated in our Privacy Policy at the time we collected such information, we will give you a reasonable opportunity to consent to the change.  If you do not consent your PII information will be used as agreed to under the terms of the privacy policy in effect at the time we obtained that information.   If we make a significant or material change in the way we use your PII, we will make you aware by prominently posting a notice on our Service 30 days in advance of such material change.  By using our Service after the Effective Date of such material changes, you are deemed to consent to our then current privacy policy, provided that we will obtain your affirmative consent where legally required.
